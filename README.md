# 👉 get_next_line

Welcome to the repo of my “get_next_line” project from 42 school.

## Description of this project

This project asks you to create a function that will read a line from a file each time it is called.

Personally, this project was challenging but a lot of fun, and it made me very familiar with valgrind 🤣. This project will get you used to paying attention to memory leakage and static variables, if you haven't already.

DON'T CLONE THIS PROJECT. As always, I recommend that you do it yourself, otherwise there's no point. This repo is there to keep track of the past. But if you ever want another perspective on the project, it can also be useful.

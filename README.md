# 👉 get_next_line

Welcome to the repo of my “get_next_line” project from 42 school.

## Description of this project

This project asks you to create a function that will read a line from a file each time it is called.

Personally, this project was challenging but a lot of fun, and it made me very familiar with valgrind 🤣. This project will get you used to paying attention to memory leakage and static variables, if you haven't already. I don't recommend cloning this repo but doing it 100% yourself, but it can help you see a direction and possibly find a starting point.
